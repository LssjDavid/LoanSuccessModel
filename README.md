#LoanSuccessModel

This project is a Machine Learning Model, Bartek and I built as a side project. This intakes a data set we got on Kaggle, linked below. The model is meant to output the loan success rates
based on the data set of bank information ranging from different categories and outputing a confusion matrix.
